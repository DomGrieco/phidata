This project is a Python-based team of AI agents that monitors and analyzes changes in U.S. government data sourced from the Congress.gov API. Its primary goal is to detect updates, such as new legislation or amendments related to the U.S. Constitution, and then compose and publish tweets about these changes. It uses multiple agent “personalities” (e.g., a Founding Fathers perspective, a Bill of Rights perspective) to produce balanced, engaging, and historically grounded commentary. Grok (xAI) will be employed in a “fun” mode to finalize tweets with a more accessible and entertaining tone. A test mode is available for development purposes, allowing the system to store tweet drafts in a local or database-based queue rather than publishing them via the Twitter API. Website and blog content will also be generated by the agents and stored in a Supabase database for a separate frontend project.

Enhanced Rules for AI Integrations (Short & Focused):

Check and Follow Docs: If any keyword matches a doc title, consult that doc first. Adhere to Phidata docs and all project docs as the primary source of truth.
No Unnecessary Overwrites: Do not remove or degrade working code without explicit instruction. Highlight proposed changes and explain the rationale.
Stay On Track: Focus on the project’s objectives: monitoring Congress.gov changes, analyzing them, creating tweets (via Grok), and preparing content for the website and blog.
Use Test Mode as Needed: If test mode is enabled, do not call external APIs. Instead, store the output (tweets, posts) in the provided database.
Ask When Unsure: If context is missing or instructions are unclear, request clarification before proceeding.

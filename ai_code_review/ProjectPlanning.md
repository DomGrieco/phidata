## Database Schema

### PgVector Collections
```sql
-- Code Patterns Collection
CREATE TABLE code_patterns (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding vector(1536),
    pattern_text TEXT,
    score FLOAT,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Similar structure for test_patterns, documentation_patterns, feedback_history
```

### Performance Metrics
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id TEXT,
    agent_type TEXT,
    operation_type TEXT,
    duration FLOAT,
    success BOOLEAN,
    score FLOAT,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Open Questions

1. **Knowledge Base Strategy**:
   - Should we use Phidata's built-in knowledge bases or create custom ones?
   - How should we structure agent-specific knowledge?

2. **Reward Functions**:
   - What metrics should influence rewards?
   - How should we weight different aspects of code quality?

3. **Agent Interaction Flow**:
   - Should agents work sequentially or in parallel?
   - How should we handle dependencies between agents?

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - What are acceptable latency thresholds?
   - How should we handle large batches of files?

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize:
   - Configuration structure
   - Database schema
   - Agent interactions
   - Learning system design
   
2. Create initial prototype:
   - Basic file monitoring
   - One agent implementation
   - Simple learning integration

3. Define development sprints
4. Set up development environment
5. Create testing strategy

Would you like me to:
1. Add sequence diagrams for agent interactions?
2. Detail specific agent reward functions?
3. Expand the configuration schema?
4. Create a detailed testing plan?

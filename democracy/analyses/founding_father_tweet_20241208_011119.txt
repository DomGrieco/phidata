Query: What was the last bill to pass into law?

Senate Bill 3960: "Good faith exceptions"? Sounds like Thomas Jefferson's version of "Oops, my bad!" 😂 But hey, fewer fines mean more freedom for inventors to innovate—keeping the power in the people’s hands! Let's keep gov't overreach in check. #LibertyForInventors #PatentPower ⚖️

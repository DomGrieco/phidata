Query: Whats the last change related to online censorship 

content="To analyze the rights implications of H.R. 10329 within the framework of the Bill of Rights, let's consider the relevant constitutional protections and potential issues related to individual rights and liberties:\n\n1. **First Amendment - Freedom of Speech**:\n   - The bill's attempt to regulate the distribution of private intimate visual depictions involves considerations of free speech and press rights. While the First Amendment broadly protects freedom of expression, this is not absolute. The Supreme Court has ruled that there are exceptions, especially in cases involving privacy violations and protecting individuals from harm (as seen in cases related to obscenity and defamation).\n   - This bill focuses on non-consensual distribution, which may not fall under the traditional protections of free speech, as it involves the rights of individuals to control their personal information and images.\n\n2. **Fourth Amendment - Right to Privacy**:\n   - The bill strongly intersects with privacy rights. Though not explicit in the Bill of Rights, the right to privacy has been interpreted through the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   - By making it unlawful to distribute private images without consent, the bill upholds privacy protections, aligning with societal interests in protecting individuals from intrusive violations of their personal lives. This reflects the recognition of personal privacy under constitutional principles.\n\n3. **Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments - Due Process and Equal Protection**:\n   - Ensuring any legal restrictions on free speech or privacy adhere to due process and equal protection under the law is critical.\n   - The legislation should provide clear definitions and regulations to avoid vague language that could lead to arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Due process considerations ensure that individuals or platforms accused of violations have a fair opportunity to contest the allegations.\n\n**Civil Rights Implications**:\n- Protecting individuals, particularly women and marginalized groups, from the non-consensual sharing of intimate materials is crucial. This aligns with expanding civil rights protection against gender-based violence and exploitation.\n- However, care must be taken to ensure that enforcement does not disproportionately affect certain groups or lead to surveillance overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, H.R. 10329, by targeting non-consensual distribution of intimate images, seeks to enhance privacy protections and mitigate harms associated with such invasions. The balance between restricting harmful speech and protecting individual rights will be essential to evaluate as the bill progresses." content_type='str' event='RunResponse' messages=[Message(role='system', content='Your role is: Analyzes legislation through Bill of Rights lens\n\n## Instructions\n- Focus on individual rights and liberties\n- Reference specific amendments and rights\n- Consider impact on constitutional protections\n- Analyze potential civil rights implications', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733636397), Message(role='user', content='Analyze the rights implications of: The most recent legislative activity related to online censorship found in the knowledge base is regarding the bill:\n\n- **Title:** "To provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions with reckless disregard for the individual\'s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes."\n- **Bill Number:** H.R. 10329\n- **Congress:** 118th\n- **Latest Action:** Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 6, 2024.\n- **Summary:** This bill addresses unauthorized distribution of private intimate visual depictions without the individual\'s consent, highlighting a legal stance against non-consensual distribution and implicitly an aspect of online censorship relating to privacy protection.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [bill document](https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/10329?format=json).', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733636397), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'id': 'call_sUVdUMKXkYMeMpBV0qKCBfhn', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"H.R. 10329, 118th Congress, rights implications"}', 'name': 'search_knowledge_base'}, 'type': 'function'}], tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={'time': 1.27325039999414, 'input_tokens': 303, 'prompt_tokens': 303, 'output_tokens': 29, 'completion_tokens': 29, 'total_tokens': 332, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, context=None, created_at=1733636398), Message(role='tool', content='No documents found', name=None, tool_call_id='call_sUVdUMKXkYMeMpBV0qKCBfhn', tool_calls=None, tool_name='search_knowledge_base', tool_args={'query': 'H.R. 10329, 118th Congress, rights implications'}, tool_call_error=False, metrics={'time': 0.6871649999957299}, context=None, created_at=1733636399), Message(role='assistant', content="To analyze the rights implications of H.R. 10329 within the framework of the Bill of Rights, let's consider the relevant constitutional protections and potential issues related to individual rights and liberties:\n\n1. **First Amendment - Freedom of Speech**:\n   - The bill's attempt to regulate the distribution of private intimate visual depictions involves considerations of free speech and press rights.

Query: Whats the last change related to online censorship 

content="Without specific documentation from a knowledge base, analyzing the constitutional implications of House Bill 10329 requires examining the constitutional principles, such as the First Amendment, separation of powers, and potential conflicts with existing legal frameworks.\n\n### Constitutional Framework Analysis\n\n1. **First Amendment Considerations**:\n   - **Freedom of Expression**: The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and expression. The bill's focus on prohibiting the distribution of private intimate images without consent could raise First Amendment concerns, particularly if the censorship is deemed overly broad or restrictive of legitimate discourse. Courts would likely evaluate whether such a law narrowly targets the relevant harm (i.e., non-consensual distribution) without infringing on protected speech.\n\n2. **Privacy Rights**:\n   - While the Constitution doesn't explicitly guarantee a right to privacy, several amendments imply such rights, which have been recognized by courts. The bill could be seen as an effort to protect individuals' privacy rights against unauthorized disclosures of intimate visual materials, aligning with existing privacy jurisprudence.\n\n3. **Separation of Powers**:\n   - **Legislative Power**: Congress has the authority to enact laws governing interstate commerce and matters affecting public welfare and safety, which can include regulating online activities. The bill's referral to the House Committee on the Judiciary signifies an early stage in the legislative process, where it undergoes detailed scrutiny.\n   - **Judicial Review**: Any enacted law might face legal challenges where the judiciary assesses its constitutionality, balancing government interests in protecting citizens against potential encroachments on individual rights.\n\n4. **Federal vs. State Authority**:\n   - The bill may raise questions about the balance of federal and state power, particularly if state laws currently address similar issues. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress can regulate activities that cross state lines, including online distribution, but it must respect state sovereignty and pre-existing laws unless explicitly preempted.\n\n5. **Due Process Concerns**:\n   - The procedural aspects of enforcing this bill may involve due process considerations for individuals accused of unlawful distribution. Ensuring fairness in how investigations and prosecutions occur is vital to uphold constitutional rights.\n\nBy balancing these aspects, the legislative process must ensure that the bill not only addresses the pressing issue of non-consensual image distribution but also aligns with constitutional mandates protecting speech, privacy, and individual rights. The outcome depends on how finely the bill can craft these boundaries and the legislative and judicial scrutiny it withstands." content_type='str' event='RunResponse' messages=[Message(role='system', content='Your role is: Analyzes legislation through constitutional framework\n\n## Instructions\n- Focus on constitutional structure and principles\n- Consider separation of powers\n- Analyze checks and balances implications\n- Reference specific constitutional provisions', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635940), Message(role='user', content='Analyze the constitutional structure implications of: The most recent related bill that touches on issues concerning online activities and potentially censorship was House Bill 10329: "To provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions with reckless disregard for the individual\'s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes." \n\n- **Congress**: 118th\n- **Latest Action**: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 6, 2024.\n- **Bill Number**: HR 10329\n- **Origin Chamber**: House\n- **Bill URL**: [HR 10329 Details](https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/10329?format=json)\n\nThis bill potentially involves online censorship as it aims to prevent the unauthorized or non-consensual distribution of private images, which is often associated with discussions on digital privacy and censorship.', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635940), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'id': 'call_m0OKGXwz8T9JmWd96dfyEkZe', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"HR 10329 online activities censorship constitutional analysis"}', 'name': 'search_knowledge_base'}, 'type': 'function'}], tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={'time': 1.0481819000051473, 'input_tokens': 302, 'prompt_tokens': 302, 'output_tokens': 24, 'completion_tokens': 24, 'total_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, context=None, created_at=1733635941), Message(role='tool', content='No documents found', name=None, tool_call_id='call_m0OKGXwz8T9JmWd96dfyEkZe', tool_calls=None, tool_name='search_knowledge_base', tool_args={'query': 'HR 10329 online activities censorship constitutional analysis'}, tool_call_error=False, metrics={'time': 0.7905548000053386}, context=None, created_at=1733635941), Message(role='assistant', content="Without specific documentation from a knowledge base, analyzing the constitutional implications of House Bill 10329 requires examining the constitutional principles, such as the First Amendment, separation of powers, and potential conflicts with existing legal frameworks.\n\n### Constitutional Framework Analysis\n\n1. **First Amendment Considerations**:\n   - **Freedom of Expression**: The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and expression.

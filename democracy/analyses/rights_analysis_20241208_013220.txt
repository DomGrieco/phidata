Query: Whats the last change related to online censorship 

content='With no specific documents available, I\'ll analyze House Bill 10329 from a Bill of Rights perspective, focusing on how it aligns with constitutional protections and potential implications for individual rights:\n\n### Relevant Constitutional Amendments\n\n1. **First Amendment: Freedom of Speech**\n    - **Issue of Censorship:** This bill seeks to make it unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions without consent. This raises concerns about potential censorship, particularly around what constitutes "reckless disregard" and how enforcement might inadvertently impact free speech.\n    - **Balancing Interests:** The interest here is balancing the right to free expression with the protection of individuals\' privacy. The bill appears narrowly tailored, focusing specifically on images that are intimate and distributed without consent, which may limit undue restriction on speech.\n\n2. **Fourth Amendment: Right to Privacy**\n    - **Expectation of Privacy:** The Fourth Amendment’s protections of privacy could support the rationale of this bill, which aims to prevent invasions of privacy through the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. This aligns with protecting individuals\' rights against unwarranted intrusion into personal life.\n\n3. **Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments: Due Process**\n    - **Due Process in Enforcement:** Any laws that affect speech or privacy must include clear standards to avoid arbitrary enforcement. It’s crucial that those accused under this bill receive fair notice of what constitutes unlawful action, ensuring due process protections are upheld.\n\n### Civil Rights Implications\n\n- **Protection Against Non-consensual Content Sharing:** The bill may serve as a critical tool for protecting individuals, particularly women and marginalized groups, against online exploitation and distribution of private images without consent. This protection aligns with promoting dignity and privacy.\n\n- **Potential for Misuse or Overreach:** There could be risks of overreach or misuse if the definitions within the bill are not clearly specified or if enforcement practices do not respect constitutional boundaries. Ensuring strict guidelines and accountability measures are essential to mitigate such risks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHouse Bill 10329 primarily seeks to protect individual privacy and autonomy by addressing the unauthorized distribution of intimate images. While it presents potential challenges to free speech, the objective appears to align with protecting personal rights against privacy invasions. The key will be implementing the bill with safeguards that respect and balance these fundamental rights, maintaining transparency and accountability in its enforcement to avoid excessive censorship or violation of due process. \n\nChoosing to uphold certain rights or limit speech requires careful legislative drafting to ensure that both privacy and free speech rights are respected and that enforcement does not become overly broad.' content_type='str' event='RunResponse' messages=[Message(role='system', content='Your role is: Analyzes legislation through Bill of Rights lens\n\n## Instructions\n- Focus on individual rights and liberties\n- Reference specific amendments and rights\n- Consider impact on constitutional protections\n- Analyze potential civil rights implications', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635931), Message(role='user', content='Analyze the rights implications of: The most recent related bill that touches on issues concerning online activities and potentially censorship was House Bill 10329: "To provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions with reckless disregard for the individual\'s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes." \n\n- **Congress**: 118th\n- **Latest Action**: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 6, 2024.\n- **Bill Number**: HR 10329\n- **Origin Chamber**: House\n- **Bill URL**: [HR 10329 Details](https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/10329?format=json)\n\nThis bill potentially involves online censorship as it aims to prevent the unauthorized or non-consensual distribution of private images, which is often associated with discussions on digital privacy and censorship.', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635931), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'id': 'call_z4FJdzo8mJZXHZgKfKibq2B1', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"House Bill 10329 online activities censorship implications"}', 'name': 'search_knowledge_base'}, 'type': 'function'}], tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={'time': 1.5101417999976547, 'input_tokens': 305, 'prompt_tokens': 305, 'output_tokens': 24, 'completion_tokens': 24, 'total_tokens': 329, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, context=None, created_at=1733635932), Message(role='tool', content='No documents found', name=None, tool_call_id='call_z4FJdzo8mJZXHZgKfKibq2B1', tool_calls=None, tool_name='search_knowledge_base', tool_args={'query': 'House Bill 10329 online activities censorship implications'}, tool_call_error=False, metrics={'time': 0.6415692000009585}, context=None, created_at=1733635933), Message(role='assistant', content='With no specific documents available, I\'ll analyze House Bill 10329 from a Bill of Rights perspective, focusing on how it aligns with constitutional protections and potential implications for individual rights:\n\n### Relevant Constitutional Amendments\n\n1. **First Amendment: Freedom of Speech**\n    - **Issue of Censorship:** This bill seeks to make it unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions without consent.

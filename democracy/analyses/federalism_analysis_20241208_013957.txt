Query: Whats the last change related to online censorship 

content="The bill, H.R. 10329 from the 118th Congress, which aims to make it unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions without consent, involves critical federalism considerations regarding the distribution of power between federal and state governments.\n\n### Federalism Principles\n\n1. **Commerce Clause**: The federal government often justifies legislative action over broad issues like online content regulation through the Commerce Clause, as online activities often cross state boundaries. Federal oversight may be argued as necessary to ensure consistent legal standards across states, especially concerning internet-based activities and platforms.\n\n2. **State Sovereignty**: States traditionally have jurisdiction over laws regarding moral conduct and privacy, including issues often encompassed by state-level revenge porn laws. The introduction of a federal law in this space could potentially encroach on state sovereignty, raising questions about states' rights to regulate activities within their own borders under the Tenth Amendment.\n\n3. **Preemption**: A federal law could either explicitly or implicitly preempt state laws dealing with non-consensual distribution of intimate materials. The legislative text would need to clarify whether it allows room for more stringent state laws or if it provides a uniform standard that would override conflicting state regulations.\n\n### Power Distribution\n\n- **Federal Oversight**: In promoting such legislation at the federal level, Congress highlights its intention to create a unified approach to regulating online activities concerning privacy protection across all states. This can be beneficial in providing a single standard, preventing a patchwork of state laws that could complicate compliance for individuals and businesses engaged in interstate commerce.\n  \n- **State Flexibility**: States might still retain flexibility to address distinct local concerns or impose stricter regulations, depending on how the law is drafted in terms of allowance for state variation. The federal law might set a floor, not a ceiling, on protections, similar to frameworks seen in environmental regulation.\n\nThis legislative move invites a dialogue about balancing the need for comprehensive privacy protections applicable nationwide, against the need for state-level adaptation to unique circumstances and preferences. The final decision on this balance will determine the distribution of authority between federal and state governments in regulating online privacy and related censorship issues." content_type='str' event='RunResponse' messages=[Message(role='system', content='Your role is: Analyzes legislation through federalism principles\n\n## Instructions\n- Focus only on federal vs state power implications\n- Reference key federalism principles from founding documents\n- Analyze power distribution between federal and state governments\n- Consider state sovereignty and federal limits', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733636388), Message(role='user', content='Analyze the federalism implications of: The most recent legislative activity related to online censorship found in the knowledge base is regarding the bill:\n\n- **Title:** "To provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions with reckless disregard for the individual\'s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes."\n- **Bill Number:** H.R. 10329\n- **Congress:** 118th\n- **Latest Action:** Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 6, 2024.\n- **Summary:** This bill addresses unauthorized distribution of private intimate visual depictions without the individual\'s consent, highlighting a legal stance against non-consensual distribution and implicitly an aspect of online censorship relating to privacy protection.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [bill document](https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/10329?format=json).', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733636388), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'id': 'call_2DtTALbkPuu2K06hsWkUuX83', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"H.R. 10329 online censorship bill federalism analysis"}', 'name': 'search_knowledge_base'}, 'type': 'function'}], tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={'time': 1.0206851999973878, 'input_tokens': 312, 'prompt_tokens': 312, 'output_tokens': 27, 'completion_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 339, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, context=None, created_at=1733636389), Message(role='tool', content='[\n  {\n    "content": "The Library of Congress Homepage Featured Items Pause Library of Congress Store Shop a vast selection of Library-themed gifts and apparel. \'Collecting Memories\' Shares Top Library Treasures Breathtaking exhibition now open in new David M.

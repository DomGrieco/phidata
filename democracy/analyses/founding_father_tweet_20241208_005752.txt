Query: What was the last bill to come into law?

Ah, Senate Bill 3960! Looks like the feds are fine-tuning patent regulation with a good faith exception. 🎭 Hope they remember, as Jefferson might say, that "a government big enough to regulate all is big enough to regulate too much!" 😉 #ConstitutionalThoughts 🗽⚖️

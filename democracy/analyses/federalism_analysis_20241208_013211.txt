Query: Whats the last change related to online censorship 

content='The most recent searches did not yield specific results regarding the federalism implications or jurisdiction issues of House Bill 10329. Nonetheless, I can offer a general federalism analysis based on the principles outlined in founding documents and traditional considerations related to federal and state powers.\n\n### Federalism Analysis of House Bill 10329\n\n1. **Federal vs. State Powers:**\n   - **Commerce Clause:** The bill potentially falls within federal jurisdiction if it relates to interstate commerce, as the distribution of private images over the internet is inherently interstate in nature. This has traditionally allowed the federal government to legislate on matters that span state boundaries or have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n   - **Protection of Individual Rights:** The bill focuses on protecting individuals from the non-consensual distribution of private images. Given the pervasive nature of internet distribution, a federal standard may be justified to ensure uniform protection across all states.\n\n2. **State Sovereignty:**\n   - **Police Power:** States traditionally have broad authority to enact laws under their police powers, which include the regulation of safety, health, and morals of their citizens. This bill overlaps with state laws on privacy and criminal activities such as revenge porn or unauthorized distribution of intimate images.\n   - **Federal Preemption:** There might be concerns over preemption, where federal law could potentially override state laws on the same issue. However, this would depend on how the federal law is crafted; if it includes a clause that allows states to enact stricter protections, it might mitigate issues of state sovereignty.\n\n3. **Federal Limits:**\n   - **10th Amendment:** This amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. Critics of federal intervention in privacy laws often argue that such matters are best managed at the state level unless there is a compelling national interest.\n   - **Balancing Interests:** The federal government must balance its interest in ensuring a baseline level of protection and individual rights with respecting state autonomy to tailor laws specific to the needs and values of their populations.\n\nIn conclusion, House Bill 10329 is an example where federalism considerations must be carefully assessed. The federal government has a legitimate interest in regulating activities with substantial interstate implications, like online activity. However, collaboration with states to respect their traditional police powers is crucial to maintaining the federal balance envisioned by the Constitution.' content_type='str' event='RunResponse' messages=[Message(role='system', content='Your role is: Analyzes legislation through federalism principles\n\n## Instructions\n- Focus only on federal vs state power implications\n- Reference key federalism principles from founding documents\n- Analyze power distribution between federal and state governments\n- Consider state sovereignty and federal limits', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635922), Message(role='user', content='Analyze the federalism implications of: The most recent related bill that touches on issues concerning online activities and potentially censorship was House Bill 10329: "To provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute private intimate visual depictions with reckless disregard for the individual\'s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes." \n\n- **Congress**: 118th\n- **Latest Action**: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 6, 2024.\n- **Bill Number**: HR 10329\n- **Origin Chamber**: House\n- **Bill URL**: [HR 10329 Details](https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/10329?format=json)\n\nThis bill potentially involves online censorship as it aims to prevent the unauthorized or non-consensual distribution of private images, which is often associated with discussions on digital privacy and censorship.', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={}, context=None, created_at=1733635922), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'id': 'call_8wSTC0RJvf8eU1tkliWwE96E', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"House Bill 10329 federalism"}', 'name': 'search_knowledge_base'}, 'type': 'function'}], tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, metrics={'time': 1.4283684999973048, 'input_tokens': 314, 'prompt_tokens': 314, 'output_tokens': 22, 'completion_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 336, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, context=None, created_at=1733635923), Message(role='tool', content='[\n  {\n    "content": "The Library of Congress Homepage Featured Items Pause Library of Congress Store Shop a vast selection of Library-themed gifts and apparel. \'Collecting Memories\' Shares Top Library Treasures Breathtaking exhibition now open in new David M.
